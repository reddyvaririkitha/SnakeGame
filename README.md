# SnakeGame
This is the old mobile game  "Snake" 🐍 which is created used using python.

Rules of the game:-
1. On eating the food, snake's tail would grow by 1 unit and you would go to next ⬆.
2. If snake colloids either with the boundary or with its own tail, the game would end ❗.

This was created using python and the module used here is "turtle" 🐢.

This was an application of OOPS concept where classes and objects were created and implemented.

Do try to play this game 🙂
