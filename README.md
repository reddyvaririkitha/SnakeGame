# SnakeGame
This is the old mobile game  "Snake" 🐍 which is created used using python.

Rules of the game:-
1. Use up ⬆, down ⬇, left ⬅ and right ➡ keys to make move on the screen.
2. On eating the food, snake's tail would grow by 1 unit, score would increase by 1 point and you would go to next level ⬆.
3. The food for the snake would be appearing at random positions on the screen on everytime the snake eats up the food.
4. If snake colloids either with the boundary or with its own tail, the game would end ❗.

This was created using python and the module used here is "turtle" 🐢.

This was an application of OOPS concept where classes and objects were created and implemented.

Do try to play this game 🙂
